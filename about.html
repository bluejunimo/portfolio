    <h1>Hi, I'm Max,</h1>
    <h2>your UX service designer.</h2>
    <p>I bridge the gap between physical and digital mediums to provide user-centered design solutions. I produce
      tangible prototypes using technology while applying soft skills to stay agile in evolving projects.</p>
    <p>While studying at the School of Interactive Arts and Technology in Vancouver Canada, iterative processes and
      design research drives the ideas and design decisions in my projects. My time spent at TU/eâ€™s Industrial Design
      exchange program in The Netherlands drives my new interests into research-through-design and tangible interaction
      design.</p>
