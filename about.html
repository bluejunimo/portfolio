    <h1>Hi, I'm Max,</h1>
    <h2>your next user experience designer.</h2>
    <p>I design products and systems that merge the best aspects of the physical and digital mediums. I strive to design
      meaningful and inclusive solutions using rich interaction methods and best practices on digital accessibility.
    </p>

    <p>Studying at Simon Fraser University’s SIAT program in Vancouver has made iterative processes and user-centered
      design methods drive project ideas and decisions. My time at TU/e’s Industrial Design exchange program in The
      Netherlands introduced me to a unique learning and working environment. Their emphasis on active reflection and
      personal development helps me bring fresh perspectives to projects today and refinements to my design process
      tomorrow.
