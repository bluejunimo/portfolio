<!-- PROJECT SUMMARY TEXT -->
<h2 class="center-children">Research Paper Abstract</h2>
<p class="center-children">In a future with more integrated smart home technologies, the interactions involving pets can
    influence the working, benefits and effectiveness of these technologies. This paper explores how technology can
    facilitate intentional interactions between humans and their cats in a home office setting. Current trends in
    productivity tools and smart desks enhancements support an improved work-life balance. Our research focuses on
    incorporating a cat-centric design into smart desks to explore human-pet cohabitation in remote work environments.
    Through need finding and cultural probes, initial qualitative data was gathered on the relationships between cats
    and their owners and on peopleâ€™s desks and their expectations on future smart desks. Through this a research
    artifact was created and deployed in a pilot study to find how the changing of technology might affect the
    interaction between technology, humans and cats. Through this pilot a recommendation was created on how to research
    this topic on a larger scale.</p>

<h2 class="center-children">About the project</h2>
<p class="center-children">In the New Futures squad of <a href="https://osiris.tue.nl/osiris_student_tueprd/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?selectie=cursus&cursus=DPB220&collegejaar=2023&taal=en" target="_blank">Project 3: Design Research</a>, we conducted a research through design process involing
    more-than-human design. With the support from <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/emilia-mjjb-viaene"
        target="_blank">Emilia Viaene</a> and <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/dan-lockton" target="_blank">Dan Lockton</a>,
    our group carried out two rounds of reserach, created a research artifact, analyzed both qualitative and
    quantitative data, and summarized our findings into a research paper.<p>
