<!-- PROJECT SUMMARY TEXT -->
<p class="center-children">Get Goo'd is a top-down, four-player, co-op slingshot shooter competitive combat game, where
    you play as slimes attending an event known as the Funeral that echoes ancient battles between Skeletons and Slimes;
    here the Goop Troop compete amongst themselves to prove who is worthy to become the next King Slime. Sling yourself
    at the Cryptlord's minions to knock them down and then eat 'em up to collect points and win the tournament.</p>
