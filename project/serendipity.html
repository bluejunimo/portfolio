<!-- PROJECT SUMMARY TEXT -->
<p>Serendipity is a physical and digital system where students in a collaborative space can vote for their favourite
    type of music to be played and shared with others. It was designed to be DIY; anyone can build them and build as
    many as needed to fill their collaborative space. As part of a three person group, I designed and created its web
    interface and the system of how it selects music in a fair manner.</p>

<p>Three physical devices allow three individuals to vote for the “vibe” or mood of music it plays in the design space.
    The vibe with a majority of votes would play.</p>

<p>A hands-on critique session with other students and our instructors helped us discover an imbalance in voting power
    which hampered music discovery. The majority could constantly vote for and play one vibe while one person’s taste in
    a less popular vibe would never be heard. This would become increasingly apparent the more devices (and therefore
    votes) were apart of the system.</p>

<p>Instead of a democratized voting system, I found that a lottery-style system created an equal playing field for
    individual voters. The vibe would be drawn at random from the votes gathered. The majority vote will still have
    great odds, but everyone’s vote now has a shot to be chosen.</p>

<p>As the project progressed, it became apparent that the group’s work was unbalanced. I took on too many tasks as my
    knowledge of web, interaction, and system design aligned with this course’s content. My group members also stuck to
    their own strengths. Next time, I will focus on developing new skills while acting as a mentor for others who focus
    on areas that I am proficient in. This way, we can distribute the tasks more evenly and foster better outcomes for
    each group member.</p>
