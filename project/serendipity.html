<!-- PROJECT SUMMARY TEXT -->
<h2 class="center-children button-margin">Our design context of 2039</h2>
<p class="center-children">With the school’s curriculum now exclusively intensive challenged-based learning, students
    will be required to spend more time in collaborative design spaces, such as Atlas’ yellow space. Yet students
    continue to use personal listening devices that separates them from the world, limiting interactions with others in
    these spaces.</p>

<h2 class="center-children button-margin">The devices</h2>
<p class="center-children">Serendipity aims to increase student connectedness, collaboration, and music discovery
    through a semi-democratized music selection system. Its three physical devices allow the student body to choose the
    “vibe” or mood of music it plays in the design space. The web interface allows students to see what’s playing and
    quickly add the song to their music library.</p>

<h2 class="center-children button-margin">The selection system</h2>
<p class="center-children">Balance of power between the student body and the individual needed to be achieved to
    accomplish Serendipity’s purpose. Our first iterations had students voting for different music genres, with the
    majority vote winning. We found a few problems when testing:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The majority would always win, disproportionally affecting unpopular genres and leaving some students hopeless
        to share their music tastes with the community.</li>
    <li>Students have pre-existing notions of the type of music a genre has, leading to less music discovery.</li>
    <li>Today’s songs intersect between genres more than ever, limiting the effectiveness of a genre-based selection
        system.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the end, we found the balance of using a lottery system and a vibe selection instead of genres. The former
    decision allows an equal chance among individual votes while more popular vibes will still have a higher change of
    being picked. The latter allows the crossover of genres while still giving you an idea of what type of music is
    going to play.</p>
