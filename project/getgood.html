<p class="center-children">Get Goo'd is a top-down, four-player, co-op slingshot shooter competitive combat game, where
    you play as slimes attending an event known as the Funeral that echoes ancient battles between Skeletons and Slimes;
    here the Goop Troop compete amongst themselves to prove who is worthy to become the next King Slime. Sling yourself
    at the Cryptlord's minions to knock them down and then eat 'em up to collect points and win the tournament.</p>

With a small amount of gameplay blocking props this room provides an interesting to look at experience with little to no gameplay struggles.

Using the Unreal Chaos system we made each props explosion even more exciting for players to want to sling into whatever they can find to gain points.

Using the Niagara system it layers two ribbon trails with one acting as the light's refraction and two the slime's personal colour glow.

Set up in the animation montages, the skeleton trails are used to display the range and timing of the skeletons' attacks each with different sizes to differentiate between.
