<!-- PROJECT SUMMARY TEXT -->
<p class="center-children">BaroNav provides hyper-local weather insights and integrates external weather services to
    record data in places you might visit to help you understand the current conditions, how those might be affecting
    you, and to prepare you for future weather shifts.</p>

smartphone sensors. The project sailed smoothly from concept to realization with our strong collaborative skills, landing an appearance in <a
