<!-- PROJECT SUMMARY TEXT -->
<p class="center-children">A team project. The culmination of all our
    prototypes and concepts relating to
    the sun, light, sound, and tangibility.
    When the sun shines, the two
    layers of coloured triangles mix
    and shine their colours on the
    surfaces of the design space.
    Each triangle has its unique sound
    dependent on the colour. The size
    and shape determine its presence
    and pitch. Each design student can add to the
    soundscape that will play every
    10 degrees of the sun’s rotation.
    The responsiveness of dropping
    triangles and how they fall
    imperfectly creates suprise in
    dynamics and expression.
    Hovering tiles over the lip
    previews the triangle’s unique
    sound, giving the user feedforward
    in their action Triangles were chosen for their simple shape
    yet varying angles, allowing unique patterns to
    emerge in the frame.</p>
